# Charm Patch

This is a collection of small changes that I think improve the balance of certain charms in the game, each of which can be toggled from the menu.

Berserker's Fury - Fury of the Fallen has a chance while active to negate damage taken.

Dark Dashmaster - Dashmaster reduces the cooldown of Shadow Dash in addition to regular Dash.

Joni's Kindness - Joni's Blessing gives more Lifeblood Masks.

Merciful Melody - Carefree Melody has a chance to heal when triggered.

Outer Shell - Baldur Shell absorbs more attacks before breaking.

## Grubberfly's Elegy
Grubberfly's Reach - Longnail and Marik of Pride increase the range of Grubberfly's Elegy

Joni's Elegy - Grubberfly's Elegy always triggers when the player is at full health, even if they took damage while equipped with Joni's Blessing

## Nail Arts
Critical Blow - Heavy Blow increases damage dealt by Nail Arts.

Mantis Arts - Longnail and Mark of Pride increase the range of Nail Arts.

Mighty Arts - Fragile/Unbreakable Strength increases the damage dealt by Nail Arts.

Quick Slash reduces the charge time of Nail Arts.

## Integrations with other mods

Blue Hive - TheMathGeek314's Unlimited Hiveblood mod heals Lifeblood Masks (including those not given by Joni's Blessing) in addition to regular ones. 

## Recommended Charm Changer Settings

Set Flukenest cost to 2

Set Dreamshield cost to 2

Set Grimmchild Attack Cooldown to 1.33

Instead of using Joni's Kindness, you can set Joni's Blessing Health Increase to 60%

Instead of using Merciful Melody, you can also balance Carefree Melody by increasing its block chance by 5%

## Special Thanks To
timbobaggins for the idea behind Critical Blow
